        <div class="govspeak govuk-!-margin-top-6">
            <p class="govuk-body">This guidance is for supervising engineers. You should follow this guidance when
                writing a written statement or a site visit report.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Owners and operators of high-risk reservoirs must appoint a competent engineer to
                supervise it at all times. They must appoint a supervising engineer if a construction engineer is not
                supervising it. This is a requirement of the Reservoirs Act 1975 (the act).</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Part of your role as a supervising engineer is to provide advice to the owner or
                operator to help them keep their reservoir safe and compliant with the act.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">You should use written statements and site visit reports to tell owners and operators
                and the Environment Agency:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>about anything which might affect the safety of the reservoir</li>
                <li>whether statutory records including the Prescribed Form of Record (<abbr
                        title="Prescribed Form of Record">PFR</abbr>) are up to date</li>
                <li>if there has been a breach of the act</li>
            </ul>
        

            <p class="govuk-!-font-size-19"> You can<a href="/Beta/V1/service-start-s3.html" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state"> submit a written statement online</a>.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Further guidance on the role and duties of supervising engineers can be found in <a

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-font-size-27">Written-statements</h2>

            <p class="govuk-body">Written statements should clearly communicate:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>apparent or possible changes to the physical condition or operation of safety-critical reservoir
                    structures, informed by visual observations, surveys and monitoring data</li>
                <li>apparent or likely changes in the threats to reservoir safety and any actual or impending changes in
                    consequential risks associated with the reservoir breach</li>
                <li>any breach of the act</li>
                <li>progress on delivering measures in the interest of safety (<abbr
                        title="measures in the interest of safety">MIOS</abbr>) and statutory maintenance</li>
                <li>clear actions on what the owner or operator must do to remain compliant with the act</li>
                <li>the priority, timescales and reasons for taking actions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-19">When to do a written statement</h3>

            <p class="govuk-body">You must provide the owner or operator with written statements:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>at least once in any calendar year about ‘matters that need to be watched’ – these are listed in the
                    annex of the final certificate or section 10(4) of the latest inspecting engineer’s report</li>
                <li>at least once every 12 months with details of any steps taken to maintain the reservoir as
                    recommended in section 10(3)(b) of the latest inspecting engineer’s report</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body">These are 2 separate legal requirements under section 12(2), and 12(2A) of the act.
                You can combine both written statements into a single document or do each one separately. State which of
                these sections of the act apply at the front of each statement.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">In practice, most supervising engineers opt to provide the owner or operator with a
                combined written statement at least every 12 months.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">You must send written statements to the owner or operator of the reservoir and the
                enforcement authority. For reservoirs located in England the enforcement authority is the Environment
                Agency.</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-19">What to include in your written statement</h3>

            <p class="govuk-body">A combined written statement should include:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>a reservoir compliance summary</li>
                <li>a completed written statement template</li>
                <li>a summary action list</li>
                <li>any site visit reports since the date of the last written statement - attach as appendices</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-19">Complete the reservoir compliance summary</h3>

            <p class="govuk-body">It is good practice to put a reservoir compliance summary at the front of your written
                statement. The summary should highlight the areas that do not comply with the act to help the owner or
                operator and the Environment Agency.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Include the questions in the <a href="#questions-template"
                    class="govuk-link">reservoir compliance summary questions template</a>, as a table or text. If any
                of your answers are ‘no’ refer to the section of the written statement that gives more details. Use text
                or colour coding to make the status clear to the owner or operator and the&nbsp;Environment Agency.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Some reservoir owners and operators will have their own preferred reservoir compliance
                summary format for supervising engineers to follow.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Record any actions needed to make sure the reservoir remains compliant with the act in
                a summary action list.</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-19">Reservoir compliance summary questions template</h3>

            <p class="govuk-body">Is the supervising engineer satisfied with the reservoir’s safety and does not need to
                recommend an early inspection? Section 12(3) of the act refers. See section 2.5.4 of the written
                statement.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Is the supervising engineer satisfied with the reservoir’s safety and does not need to
                direct (legally compel) the owner or operator to carry out visual inspections? Section 12(6) of the act
                refers. See section 2.6&nbsp;of the written statement.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Is the supervising engineer satisfied with the progress of carrying out measures in
                the interest of safety (<abbr title="measures in the interest of safety">MIOS</abbr>)? Section 10(3)(c)
                of the act refers.&nbsp; See section 2.5.2&nbsp;of the written statement.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Is the supervising engineer satisfied that all matters to be watched (legally required
                to check) are in compliance with the construction or inspecting engineer’s instructions? Section 12(2)
                of the act refers. See section 2.3&nbsp;of the written statement.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Is the owner or operator compliant with their duties for monitoring, surveillance and
                record keeping? Sections 6, 9 and 11 of the act refer. See section 2.4&nbsp;of the written statement.
            </p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Has the owner or operator satisfactorily completed any statutory maintenance
                recommendations? Section 12(2A) of the act refers.&nbsp; See section 2.2&nbsp;of the written statement.
            </p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Does the owner or operator have a certified, up to date&nbsp;and satisfactory
                on-site&nbsp;emergency&nbsp;flood&nbsp;plan? Section 12AA of the act refers. See section 2.7&nbsp;of the
                written statement.</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-19">Complete a written statement template</h3>

            <p class="govuk-body">This section provides a template of section headings for your written statement. It
                also gives some advice on completing it and things you need to consider.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Although considered good practice, it is not a legal requirement to follow this
                format. Some reservoir owners and operators will have their own preferred template for supervising
                engineers to use.</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-19">1. General information</h3>

            <p class="govuk-body">1.1 Reservoir name</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">This should exactly match the registered name given in the Prescribed Form of Record
                (<abbr title="Prescribed Form of Record">PFR</abbr>). Note also any local names used for the reservoir.

                <li>other people to distribute the written statement to</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body">The undertaker (owner or operator) should tell you who to report to and who to
                escalate outstanding matters to. This should be the individual responsible for reservoir safety.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">In larger organisations, this should be the person responsible for corporate safety at
                director level (or equivalent). In the case of single owners, clubs or small companies, this should be
                the owner (or equivalent).</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">1.4 Name and address of supervising engineer</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">1.5&nbsp;Alternative supervising engineer contact details</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">1.6&nbsp;Name of last inspecting engineer or construction engineer</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-19">2. Status and findings</h3>

            <p class="govuk-body">2.1 Construction engineer’s requirements in relation to section 6(2) to 6(4) or 9(2)
            </p>

            <p class="govuk-body">This relates to new reservoirs or re-use of abandoned reservoirs.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Note any specific requirements from the construction engineer’s final certificate that
                the owner or operator must adhere to. Use sub-headings in this section, if required.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Include any matters to be watched by the supervising engineer from the final
                certificate. Highlight any special requirements or matters that need to be watched that are complete or
                outstanding. Use text or colour coding to make this clear to the owner or operator and the Environment
                Agency.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">2.2&nbsp;Statement under section 12(2A) on the directions given for maintenance of the

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>state whether the owner or operator has followed the inspecting engineer’s instructions - use text

                <li>include the status of the direction – is it complete or ongoing?</li>
                <li>comment, if necessary, on the actions taken or not by the owner or operator</li>

            <p class="govuk-body">List all the matters that you are watching.  Make a note against each one about their
                status. Comment on any actions taken and whether there are any issues or concerns relating to these

            <p class="govuk-body">You should visit the reservoir often enough to carry out your duties. In practice (and
                unless under very exceptional circumstances) this should be at least once a year. In many cases it may
                be more appropriate to visit at least twice a year.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Refer to the recommendations of the construction engineer or last inspecting engineer
                as guidance. Visit at different times of the year to allow you to observe the reservoir operating under
                different conditions.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">You should visit the reservoir as soon as possible after any significant change in the
                condition or operation of the dam. This could be after:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>a change in reservoir ownership</li>
                <li>a significant flood</li>

                <li>seismic activity</li>
                <li>any other event that could affect reservoir safety</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-19">When to do a site visit report</h3>

            <p class="govuk-body">You should write a site visit report each time you visit the reservoir.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Write a full and detailed site visit report annually. For interim site visits during
                the year you can write a shorter report if appropriate.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Submit your site visit reports to the reservoir owner or operator after each visit and
                include them as appendices to the next written statement.</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-19">What to include in the site visit report</h3>

            <p class="govuk-body">Your site visit report should include:</p>

                <li>photographs</li>
                <li>instrument readings and graphs</li>
                <li>clear comments on the condition of all elements of the reservoir and associated structures</li>
                <li>a summary action list with priority and timescale for each action</li>
                <li>comments on the significance of any issues and actions so the owner or operator knows why they need
                    to take action</li>
                <li>any specific changes in the reservoir condition since the last site visit</li>
                <li>any changes since the last section 10 inspection and the last site visit</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body">When writing the report the supervising engineer should take into account the owner or
                operator’s technical knowledge, the resources they have and the type of reservoir. Write in clear
                English using terminology that is appropriate for the type of owner or operator and their experience.

            <p class="govuk-body">State if the action is necessary to remain compliant with the act. Assess the action
                or maintenance activity and assign it a priority category. Use the following as a guide to complete the
                summary action list for your written statement or site visit report:</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-19">Priority ‘low’</h3>

            <p class="govuk-body">This action relates to&nbsp;non-urgent matters&nbsp;or&nbsp;could&nbsp;be done as part
                of wider planned works.&nbsp;The owner or operator should be informed and the action completed with
                other ongoing planned works.</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-font-size-19">Priority ‘high’</h3>

            <p class="govuk-body">This action will directly affect safety&nbsp;or&nbsp;the&nbsp;ability to examine the
                reservoir&nbsp;if not resolved.&nbsp;Supervising engineers should assess the urgency of the action and
                state a recommended timescale for starting and completing it.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">If you have significant concerns or are in any doubt you should consult the inspecting
                engineer or recommend an early section 10 inspection.</p>
